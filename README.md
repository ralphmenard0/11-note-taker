11 Express.js: Note Taker
License: MIT

Description
Refactored starter-code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes using an Express.js back-end. Notes are saved and retrieved from a JSON file. Front-end code was included in starter code.

Motivation
This project our first foray into truly full-stack web design as part of our Full Stack Bootcamp through the University of Washington.

Learning Targets
This exercise provided my first experience with building an Express.js server, writing all back end code and connecting it to the front end, and deploying an application in Heroku.
